# Salary Calculator

[Project Instructions](./INSTRUCTIONS.md), this line may be removed once you have updated the README.md

## Description

The salary calculator collects employee info, lists the employee info, and keeps track of the total monthly salary amount for all of the employee's.

My problem was updating the monthly salary background to red if the total is over 20,000. The problem was solved using an if else loop. I set the loop to say, "if the total monthly is greater than 20,000, then add css background color red to the total monthly background. If not, add css background color to white".

I made sure to include the css background white because the red background would remain red if the total monthly was changed to less than 20,000 (which is incorrect. The red should disappear).
